# Notebook Graph Workflow Compositor
Computing at the speed of Human: A tool by alshady
Intuitive, high-level visual design and execution of complex workflows and analysis pipelines.
Not a visual programming language, a visual compositor to archtect complex systems.

## A Jupyter notebook frontend for Godot
* Notebooks let designers write and seemlessly execute code from ipython and 100+ popular programming languages via Jupyter inside Godot GraphNodes
* Each Jupyter notebook acts as an independent entity which may be connected to arbitrary graphnodes in a scene.
* A Jupyter kernel must be installed on a linux system. Currently notebooks can only be processed as one-shot on the local system.

## A dynamic GUI toolkit
* Advanced GraphNode: extends the base godot graphnode to support type-checking of inputs/outputs and a dynamically generated GUI.
* Auto-generate GUI from from objects or scene-trees or JSON files.
* A variety of implementations of drag-and-drop / resizable windows in Godot.
* A fancy retro green terminal theme.  

### Why Jupyter + Godot? Some possibilities...  
* Godot 2d/3d/VR engines for high-quality data visualizations.
* In-game dynamic generation of text, image, audio and video content.
* create detailed live web-based dashboards for server monitoring and admin.
* seamlessly pull data from a wide variety of sources into games/simulations.
* generate, store, modify gameworlds both in-game and in-browser.
* load, view, edit godot savegames in Jupyter.
* building complex automated workflows with high levels of flexability and debugability.
* design simulations in Jupyter and running them in Godot
